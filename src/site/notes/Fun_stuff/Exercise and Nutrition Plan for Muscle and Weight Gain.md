### Week 5-8: Intensification
- Increase weight for each exercise while aiming for 3 sets x 8 reps
- Introduce one more exercise per muscle group

### Week 9-12: Specialization
- Focus on weak points and prioritize them in workouts
- Further increase weight and adjust rep ranges to 3 sets x 6-8 reps

**Note**: Always warm up before starting and cool down after workouts. For the left shoulder, avoid any exercise that causes discomfort and consider seeing a physiotherapist for targeted exercises.

## Nutrition

- **Caloric Intake**: Around 2500-3000 calories/day
- **Macronutrients**: 
  - Protein: 1.8g/kg of body weight
  - Carbs: 3-4g/kg of body weight
  - Fats: Remainder of calories
- **Meal Timing**: Try to eat 4-6 smaller meals throughout the day to make it easier to consume more calories.

## Lifestyle

- **Sleep**: The current sleep pattern is not bad, but try aiming for 8 hours for optimal recovery.
- **Stress**: Stress levels are low, which is good for recovery and muscle gain.

## Monitoring & Adjustments

- Weekly weigh-ins to monitor weight gain
- Every 4 weeks, evaluate strength and muscle gain to adjust the program

**Disclaimer**: Please remember to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new fitness or nutrition program, especially given the history of shoulder dislocation.
