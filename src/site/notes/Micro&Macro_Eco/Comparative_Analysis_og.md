# From Finance to Pandemic: A Comparative Analysis of Global Economic Responses in 2008 and 2020

## Ideas and directions
We are making comparisons about the effects of two historical events. 2007-2008 financial crisis and 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. **To write this paper, first consider how to make our comparisons.**
### An analogy - Compare two different apples.
When comparing two different apples, there are various characteristics you can evaluate to differentiate between them.

1. **Appearance**:
    
    - **Color**: Some apples are red, some are green, and others are a combination of colors. The color can sometimes (but not always) indicate sweetness or tartness.
    - **Size**: Different apple varieties come in different sizes.
    - **Shape**: While most apples are round, their profiles can vary. Some might be taller, while others are flatter.
2. **Texture**:
    
    - **Skin Thickness**: Some apples have a thick skin that's a bit tough to bite into, while others have thin, smooth skin.
    - **Firmness**: An apple might be hard and crisp, or it might be softer and mealy. Crispness is often a desired trait.
3. **Taste**:
    
    - **Sweetness**: Some apples are naturally sweeter than others.
    - **Tartness**: Some apple varieties are more tart or sour.
    - **Complexity of Flavor**: Beyond just sweet or tart, some apples have unique flavor profiles.

### Similarly, we can assess the effects of both events using a number of data points
For a full list of data points you might want to consider, see the chapter [[Micro&Macro_Eco/Comparative_Analysis_og#^cf658e\| Data points for comparison]] 
Data points serve as a cornerstone for objective analysis, offering quantifiable and empirical evidence that minimizes biases and subjective interpretations. Their inherent standardization facilitates consistent comparison of performance across diverse entities or varying time frames. Furthermore, the nature of data ensures clarity and precision, enabling analysts to gain specific insights and accurately pinpoint emerging trends or nuanced changes.

#### Tip
When compare data points keep in mind that we are dealing with data with more than 10 years span. So the number itself is not so meaningful, as a lot of things changed during those 12 years.
As a result, focus on the changes and trends withing a fixed period. For example the GDP growth from 2007-2010 and 2020-2023 (three year period).

### Other methods can also be used
**Qualitative Analyses:**

- **Case Studies**: Deep dives into specific instances or examples can provide rich contextual information often missed by broad data points.
- **Interviews and Surveys**: These can capture subjective experiences, opinions, and sentiments which aren't always reflected in quantitative data.

Note that our paper is about the effects/consequences of two events. So the causes shouldn't be discussed in the body of our paper. Instead, write them in the introduction part.

## Outline of this paper
This is only my suggestion.

1. Introduction
	1. Our motivation of making this research
	2. Briefly introduce 2008 financial crisis
		1. Time
		2. Causes
	3. Briefly introduce 2020 Covid-19 pandemic
		1. Time
		2. Causes
		3. Non-financial effects - Global health problem
	4. Methods & data points used for comparison
	5. Data sources
2. Similarities
	1. First data
		1. Describe the data
		2. Maybe give illustrations (charts, graphs)
		3. Why we are seeing this similarity in two dramatically different events?
	2. Second data
		1. Same drill
	3. Go on
3. Differences - Same structure as above
4. Conclusion
	1. Recap of Main Findings:
    
	    - Briefly revisit the key similarities and differences you've identified between the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic.
	2. Implications:
    
	    - Discuss what these similarities and differences mean for the global economy, policymakers, businesses, and individuals.
	    - Reflect on what these findings suggest about the resilience or vulnerabilities of the global economic system.
	3. Limitations of Your Research:
    
	    - Every research has its limitations, whether it's the scope, the data points, or the methods. Acknowledging them not only lends credibility to your work but also sets the stage for further research.
	4. Recommendations for Further Research:
    
	    - Suggest areas where more in-depth study could be valuable based on your findings or the limitations you've identified.
